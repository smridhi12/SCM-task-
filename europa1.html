        <p>The smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, Europa is a winter lover’s dream.
            With an icy surface, it’s perfect for a bit of ice skating, curling, hockey, or simple relaxation in your
            snug wintery cabin.<br>
            The average distance from earth would be around <i><u>628 million km </u></i>and the estimated time for our flight
            would be <i><u> 3 years</u></i> .
            <br><br>

            <u>Spacecraft:</u><br>
            Europa Clipper is a Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft carrying science instruments to study Jupiter’s icy moon
            Europa. With a
            sophisticated suite of scientific instruments, Europa Clipper will be the most advanced spacecraft ever sent
            to investigate
            the habitability of another world.<br>A metal box known as a radiation vault will shield Europa Clipper’s
            electronics from
            Jupiter’s harsh radiation. The vault’s walls are an alluminum alloy about 0.3 inches (9.2 millimeters)
            thick.<br><br>

            <u>Cost:</u><br>


            The cost of the flight will be $300k, while the cost of a landing
            on
            Europa will be $400k.<br>
