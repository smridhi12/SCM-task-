<dl><dt><u>Mars-Landing:</u></dt>
          <dd> As of 2021, all methods of landing on Mars have used an aeroshell and parachute sequence for Mars 
atmospheric entry and descent, but after the parachute is detached, there are three options:
<ul><li> A stationary lander</li>
<li>lighter rover tetrahedral structure</li>
<li>The sky crane for heavy rovers</li></ul><dd>

<dt><u>Spacecraft:</u></dt>
        <dd>Space Up is planned to be a long-duration cargo- and passenger-carrying spacecraft launched as the
second stage of a reusable launch vehicle. While it will be tested on its own initially, it will be used on 
orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super Heavy, where Starship will serve as the second stage on a
two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle.The combination of spacecraft and booster is called STARSHIP as well.</dd></dl>
