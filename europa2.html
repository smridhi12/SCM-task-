    <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 50%; width: 700px ">Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of
        silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an
        iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks
        and
        streaks, but craters are relatively few.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 50%; width: 659px; ">a) Shallow lakes-The presence of shallow lakes also
        means that surface waters are probably vigorously mixing with deeper water.<br>The icy eddies could transfer
        nutrients between the surface water and the ocean's depths. <br> "That could make
        Europa and its ocean more habitable," said lead author Britney Schmidt from the University of Texas at Austin,
        US, who <br>
        analysed images collect by the Galileo spacecraft launched in 1989.<br>
        Glaciologists have been studying the surface of Europa for many years, trying to work out what formed its
        scarred,
        fractured surface. <br> </p>
